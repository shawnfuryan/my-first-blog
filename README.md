This repo is the result of following the DjangoGirls tutorial located at http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/

I've gone through it to evaluate it as a pedagogical tool, and have come away impressed.

It doesn't take you through every best practice, but hits a lot of the biggest issues, and is relatively minimal, avoiding recommending personal pet tricks in favor of quickly getting up a workable starting point. This is very welcome approach in a Djanog Tutorial for beginners, as Django can tend toward impenetrability to the uninitiated. At the same time, it gets you through enough of the necessary best practices that you're not left with a useless toy demo, but rather leaves you with a minimal system that can be tweaked in the direction of production quality.
